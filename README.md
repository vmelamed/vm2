# vm2
This is a ancestor of my `vm` library which was a great help during the .NET Framework and WCF days. The world and I moved on to .NET Core, Web API (unfortunately), and gRPC (great!), and so did I. Here it is.

## The first project is a library of regular expressions which evolve and got tested and re-tested over the years.
