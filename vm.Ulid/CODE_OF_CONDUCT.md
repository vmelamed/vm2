# Code of Conduct

All contributors, maintainers and visitors to this project are expected to follow this Code of Conduct. The goal is to foster an
open, respectful, and productive community.

## Our pledge

We pledge to be respectful, considerate, and constructive. We will be mindful of our language and behaviour, and we will work to
create an inclusive environment for everyone regardless of background, identity, or experience.

## Expected behaviour

- Be professional, polite, and constructive in issues, pull requests, reviews, chat and other communications.
- Assume good faith and seek clarification before escalating disagreements.
- Give and accept feedback gracefully; prefer private channels for sensitive or critical discussions.
- Respect people's time and differing levels of experience.

## Unacceptable behaviour

The following are examples of unacceptable behaviour and will not be tolerated:
- Harassment, bullying, or abusive language.
- Discriminatory comments related to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, or other protected
  characteristics.
- Personal attacks, threats, or doxxing.
- Posting sexual content, hate speech, or anything illegal.
- Repeatedly submitting low-quality or disruptive contributions after being asked to stop.

## Reporting incidents

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour:

1. Prefer opening a private report by contacting the maintainers at: `valo@vtmelamed.com`, or
2. Open a confidential issue in this repository and mark it with the label `conduct` (if available), or
3. If urgent or involving safety, contact the appropriate platform or local authorities.

Please include:
- A short description of the incident
- Links to relevant conversations, PRs, or commits (if applicable)
- Your contact information (optional) and whether you prefer confidentiality

## Enforcement

Reports will be reviewed by project maintainers. Responses may include:

- Private discussion and mediation
- A request to modify or remove content
- Temporary or permanent removal of commenting/repository access
- Referral to platform or legal authorities for severe incidents

Decisions will be made at maintainers' discretion with fairness and confidentiality.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (issues, PRs, mailing lists, chat channels, events) and to individuals representing the project in public forums.

## Attribution

This document is a project-specific code of conduct. It is inspired by common community conduct policies and adapted for this repository.
